# Lessons — Flier Canvassing Platform

Append non-obvious constraints and pitfalls here as the build proceeds, so the next
agent doesn't relearn them (CLAUDE.md §"Self-improvement loop").

## Patterns (recurring)
- (none yet)

## Pitfalls (one-off traps)
- **PRD absent from repo.** `docs/prd.md` (`flier-canvassing-platform-PRD-v0.4.0.md`) was
  referenced by CLAUDE.md but not delivered with the spec bundle. The Batch task cards
  quote every FR-* / EC-* requirement they depend on inline, so the build proceeds from
  the cards + constitution. If a card cites a PRD section not quoted inline, insert a
  `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` note rather than guessing. See `docs/prd.md`.
